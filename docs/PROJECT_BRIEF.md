# Project Brief

## Document Role
This is stable project context and success criteria.
It should not prescribe layout, UI patterns, or final copy.

## Purpose
Create a landing page to recruit suitable nonprofits into a time-bounded fundraising pilot.

This is not a product launch page and not a broad waitlist page.

## Pilot Context (working)
- Pilot runs ahead of public Apps launch timing.
- Pilot licenses expected to be free for approximately four months.
- Participation should have no obligation to continue after pilot.
- Selection is application-based, not open self-serve onboarding.

## What This Page Must Do
- Convert qualified interest into applications.
- Distinguish pilot recruitment from product availability.
- Establish credibility without hype.
- Show why participation is worth team time, not just cost-free.
- Set realistic expectations and reduce ambiguity about post-pilot paths.

## Landing Page Priority (Current)
For this phase, the priority is the landing page only:
- maximize the chance that the right nonprofits decide to complete the application.
- optimize for qualified intent, not broad volume.
- defer detailed application-form design to a separate phase.

## Conversion Model
- `LinkedIn post`: attention + legitimacy.
- `Landing page`: core conversion surface; clear value, bounded risk, and concrete scope.
- `Application form`: qualification and fit filtering.

## 3-Layer Persuasion Model
1. `Attention layer` (post/social): create qualified curiosity and click intent.
2. `Evaluation layer` (landing page): resolve the main decision barriers and drive apply intent.
3. `Due diligence layer` (optional deeper detail): support larger, risk-averse organizations without overloading the main page.

## Message Development Order
1. Nonprofit decision frame.
2. Risk-removal story.
3. Upside story.
4. Fit filter.

Only then write final page copy.

## What This Page Is Not
- A full product marketing site.
- A deep technical architecture document.
- A promise of final GA capabilities or pricing.

## Working Principle
Treat all current statements as provisional until validated against live pilot decisions and direct conversations.
