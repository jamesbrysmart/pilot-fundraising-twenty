# Landing Page Plan

## Purpose
Define the foundation for a high-conviction pilot landing page that helps the right nonprofits decide to apply.

This is a planning document for narrative, proof, and experience direction.
It is intentionally not a rigid wireframe, template, or design spec.

## How To Use This Doc (Important)
Treat everything here as guidance, not compliance.

- Prefer outcomes over prescriptions: if a design choice serves the goal better, use it.
- “Avoid” lists are risk flags, not bans. Break them when you have a clear reason and the page stays credible.
- The page should be allowed to feel exciting and “worth being part of,” while staying calm, competent, and non-hype.

## Success Definition
The page succeeds when suitable mid-sized nonprofits with active fundraising operations decide:
"This is worth our team's time, and we should apply."

## Strategic Position
- This is a structured pilot invitation, not a product launch.
- The page is a decision surface, not a brochure.
- Conversion quality matters more than raw traffic.

## Core Narrative Spine
1. Relevance: this helps evaluate a decision they already need to make.
2. Credibility-on-entry: this is structured, serious, and real.
3. Contained downside: parallel evaluation, no forced migration commitment.
4. Tangible value: meaningful outcomes even if they do not continue.
5. Fit discipline: designed for organizations with active fundraising operations.
6. Forward path: clear, optional path if pilot outcomes are positive.

## Psychological Journey
1. Skeptical: "another vague CRM pitch"
2. Relevant: "this maps to an existing priority"
3. Safe enough: "downside is bounded"
4. Valuable: "this can produce concrete decision value"
5. Trusting: "this appears competent and intentional"
6. Ready: "we should apply"

## Thematic Anchors (Flexible, Non-Rigid)
Use these as content anchors. They can be merged or split in implementation.

### A) Entry Credibility + Relevance
- Fast clarity on audience and purpose.
- Immediate signal this is a serious, limited pilot.

### B) Pilot Model Clarity
- What participation actually is.
- What it is not.
- Why this is parallel evaluation rather than migration pressure.

### C) Observable Product Reality
- Show real workflows with concise explanation.
- Prioritize visual evidence and scenario coherence.
- Avoid feature catalog language.

### D) End-of-Pilot Value
- Explicitly state what organizations walk away with after the pilot period.
- Focus on practical outputs, not abstract claims.

### E) Fit + Boundaries
- Signal who this is best suited for.
- Quietly discourage low-fit applications through scope clarity.

### F) Forward Path
- Clarify what happens if the pilot works.
- Keep language clear but non-overcommitted.

## Proof Strategy (No Customer Logos/Testimonial Dependency)
Use operational proof that is observable:
- Real product visuals (selected, high-signal scenarios).
- Short product walkthrough video.
- Concrete pilot operating model details (duration, cohort, structure).
- Named workflows and tangible pilot outputs.
- Clear platform context and initiative seriousness.

Proof principles:
- Show more than describe.
- Use a few strong scenarios, not broad inventories.
- Keep proof close to the claims it supports.

## Product Presentation Direction
Goal: communicate a strong, coherent product experience without turning the page into documentation.

Design intent:
- Excitement through clarity and quality, not hype.
- Visible operational depth through selected workflows.
- Progressive reveal for details when needed.

Watch for:
- Feature lists that replace proof.
- Dense technical explanation on the primary path (move to optional deeper material).
- Copy-heavy blocks that claim more than they can show.

## Experience Principles
- Calm, selective, competent tone.
- High information clarity with low cognitive load.
- Repeated apply opportunities at natural decision points.
- Scannable hierarchy for busy decision-makers.
- Optional deeper material referenced where relevant, but not required to understand core value.

## UX/UI Guidance (Non-Prescriptive)
We want a page that feels:
- serious enough to trust,
- alive enough to engage,
- specific enough to believe,
- bounded enough to feel safe.

The exact visual language is intentionally flexible. If a bolder approach increases “I want to be part of this” while preserving credibility, take it.

## What We Are Not Solving In This Doc
- Detailed application form design.
- Full technical deep-dive content.
- Final brand/legal approval language.

## Build-Ready Outputs To Create Next
1. Page concept map:
   narrative spine -> thematic anchors -> proof artifacts.
2. Content brief per anchor:
   purpose, core claim, proof artifact, desired reader action.
3. Low-fidelity layout direction:
   one desktop and one mobile narrative flow draft.
4. Asset list:
   screenshots, short video, pilot details needed for credible claims.

## Open Decisions (To Resolve Before Build)
1. Final naming/labeling conventions for the pilot.
2. Exact proof artifacts available immediately (screens, video, both).
3. Required specificity of pilot outcomes that can be stated confidently.
4. Degree of selectivity language strength on the page.

## Asset Checklist (For Build Start)
- 2-3 clean product screenshots mapped to named scenarios.
- One short walkthrough video (or script placeholder if video not ready).
- Confirmed pilot structure facts (duration, cohort framing, participation model).
- Draft end-of-pilot outcomes list (specific and non-technical).
- Fit criteria statements for on-page filtering.

## Appendix: Optional Patterns (Use If Helpful)
This appendix is intentionally optional. It exists to offer patterns that commonly work for this kind of page, not to constrain creativity.

### Optional Visual Starting Point (If You Need One)
- A restrained “initiative briefing” look can work well for credibility.
- A more editorial/proof-forward look can work well for engagement.
- Either is acceptable if claims-to-proof remains tight and the page stays calm and non-hype.

### Optional Section Pattern Guidance
- Hero: aim for fast relevance + clear action; details can come later.
- Proof: show a few strong scenarios (not a catalog); keep proof adjacent to claims.
- Value: describe outputs as artifacts, not promises.
- Fit: filter without gatekeeping tone.

### Common Risks (Not Bans)
- Generic SaaS template feel: can reduce perceived seriousness.
- Memo-only feel: can reduce momentum and scanning.
- Platform-clone feel: can create confusion about ownership/relationship.
- Charity-campaign aesthetic: can dilute product-operational credibility.
