# Landing Page Messaging Operating Brief (Canonical)

Owner: Copy / Content Lead  

Guidance note:
- This brief sets messaging guidance for the current iteration.
- Teams can diverge from wording patterns when it improves conversion clarity and keeps claims truthful.

## Working Context (Current Build)
Current routes for iteration:
- `/` = active landing copy track + application sheet/panel (primary apply surface)

Iteration rule:
- Current execution is baseline-first iteration on `/`.
- Additional route experiments can be reintroduced only if explicitly requested.

## Job To Do
Write copy that makes the right nonprofit teams instantly understand:
1) what this is (fundraising CRM for nonprofits), and
2) why it is worth attention now (modern alternative + real progress), and
3) why it is safe to engage (no cutover during pilot + clean exit).

Primary action: apply. Secondary action: click for more information.

## Provisional Baseline: Core vs Additional (Depth Split)
This split is the main lever for keeping the experience engaging without losing credibility. Treat it as a default, not a rigid rule.

Reader modes:
- Mode 1 (fast): “What is this and should I care?”
- Mode 2 (diligence): “Is this safe and real enough for my org?”

Depth rule (not topic rule):
- Core can reference any topic as a one-line cue if it increases first-scan confidence.
- Additional provides the definitions, mechanics, scope, and nuance after another click.

Expected qualified flow (typical, not exclusive):
- open -> click more info -> apply
- repeat views before applying are likely and acceptable

Practical sorting rule:
- If a line increases desire/confidence for a qualified reader in under ~2 seconds, it belongs in Core.
- If it mainly answers edge cases or prevents misinterpretation, it belongs in Additional.

## Core Guidance (Landing Page)
Goal: in ~10 seconds, a qualified reader can classify the offer and choose a path (keep reading, open details, apply later, forward internally).

Category clarity:
- The first screen should clearly say: **fundraising CRM for nonprofits**.

Core should help a reader understand (conceptual, not scripted):
- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- Why pay attention now?
- What is the high-level promise?
- What is the one-line safety rail?
- What do we walk away with?
- What is the next step?

Core is allowed to include light “fast FAQ” cues:
- A small set of short Q/A items can be part of Core if it helps first-scan confidence (while keeping depth in Additional).

Core truth posture:
- Prefer plain, human sentences.
- Use headline cues for important trust signals (e.g., free, no commitment, built on Twenty) with deeper explanation in Additional.

## Additional Guidance (After Another Click)
Goal: give serious evaluators enough depth to say “this is real and safe enough for our org,” without dragging every reader into diligence mode.

Additional typically includes:
- pilot mechanics and support cadence
- definitions and mechanics (what “subset” means; how exit works)
- scope boundaries (including “no custom code”; how gaps are handled)
- security/privacy posture (even if lightweight)
- integrations and current limitations
- continuation path language (non-committal; no pricing)
- “built on Twenty” relationship context
- FAQ (free, cohort size, duration, production readiness)

## Shared Messaging Concepts (Menu For Variants)
Use these as high-level concepts that variants can combine. Not all concepts must appear in every variant, and wording is intentionally flexible.

Opportunity energy concept (selective opportunity, no hype):
- The page can carry “worth being part of now” energy without sales pressure.
- Variants should feel free to test a low-to-high energy dial (from calm/briefing to more forward-moving/compelling), while staying credible and specific.

Core promise concept:
- A fundraising CRM for nonprofits, offered through a structured pilot that creates real workflow evidence and real progress (not just a product tour).

Time-value concept (team time > “free”):
- This is worth time because it produces durable decision value (clarity + artifacts), not because it is cost-free.

Decision-assets concept (what you walk away with):
- End-of-pilot outputs should be framed as artifacts a team can use (requirements baseline, findings, decision brief).

Selectivity concept (quality over volume):
- Application-based cohort; designed for teams with active workflows and internal ownership capacity.

Bounded-risk concept (one-line safety rail, with depth elsewhere):
- Core can carry a short safety cue; Additional carries the mechanics and nuance.

Claims-to-proof concept:
- Any major claim should sit next to a proof cue (scenario screenshots/video, artifact preview, or concrete operating detail).

Platform context concept (use lightly):
- “Built on Twenty” can be a credibility cue; keep relationship context clear but not dominant.

The three truths (keep consistent; vary depth by Core vs Additional):
1) Parallel build-out: “set up alongside your current system”
2) No cutover during pilot: “we don’t ask you to switch systems during the pilot”
3) Realistic data scope: “enough real data to test workflows (not a full migration)”

Scope boundary concept:
- Pilot work is limited to what exists today and what’s agreed in scope; no custom code during pilot; gaps become explicit findings.

The fork concept (should be clear somewhere):
- Stop cleanly vs continue smoothly; continuation is optional and determined after pilot review.

Proof cue concept (minimum believable set):
- 2–3 scenario screenshots, optional short video only if crisp, and one artifact preview.

CTA posture concept:
- Application-focused (avoid “early access” / “free trial” framing).

## Suggested Spine (Default Starting Order)
This is a recommended starting order for the control page and for early variants. It is not a constraint.

Suggested journey:
`classification -> belief -> value -> fit -> next step`

Default section order:
1) Hero: what this is, why it matters, next step
2) Why now: relevance and timing
3) What this is / is not: headline boundaries (depth lives in Additional)
4) Proof scenarios: show workflows and what they demonstrate
5) End-of-pilot value: decision assets / outcomes
6) Fit / boundaries: who it is designed for
7) Forward path: stop cleanly vs continue smoothly
8) Final CTA: apply + reassurance

Variant deviation rule:
- Variants may reorder sections (especially moving Proof earlier) if it improves clarity and momentum.
- When deviating, preserve the same journey and avoid changing both structure and message so much that comparison becomes impossible.
