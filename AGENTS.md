## Operating Principle: Iterate For Quality
This project is not constrained by internal build/design/copy bandwidth.

- Default posture: implement quickly, review the artifact, iterate.
- Avoid decisions framed as "we don't have time" or "we don't have resources" unless a real external constraint exists.
- Documentation should guide outcomes, not prescribe layouts or constrain creativity.

## Collaboration Norms
- Prefer a shared, working implementation over long speculative discussions.
- Keep docs and code consistent; deprecate docs that no longer match the current direction.

## Documentation Discipline
The goal of documentation here is alignment, not control.

- Canonical docs should stay high-level: themes, principles, and intent (not layouts or component specs).
- Iteration-specific docs are encouraged (e.g., `v3` track notes, implementation checklists) as long as they are scoped to that iteration and used to ship artifacts.
- Prefer guidance phrased as positive intent (“aim for…”, “optimize for…”) over lists of constraints or “do not” rules.
- If detailed implementation guidance is helpful, keep it close to the implementation (code, inline notes, or an explicitly optional appendix).
